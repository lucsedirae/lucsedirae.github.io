          <p>
            Jon grew up in the rural Piedmont region of Virginia in the shadow
            of the Blue Ridge Mountains. He and his wife of 10 years now live in
            Richmond and have fallen in love with the community. When Jon's not
            coding he's either making music or listening to it.
