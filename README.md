# Jon Deavers - Profile

Deployed site: https://lucsedirae.github.io/

This website is a student profile page. It features a fun, animated user<br>
interface and intuitive navigation. On the page you will find links to Jon's<br>
portfolio projects and blog articles, contact information, and a short bio.<br>
Below are descriptions of components built and tools used in this application.<br>

## Featuring [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) animation library

"[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) (/ˈæn.ə.meɪ/) is a lightweight JavaScript animation library with a simple, yet <br>
powerful API. It works with CSS properties, SVG, DOM attributes and JavaScript Objects."<br>
-*anime.js homepage*

I incorporated anime.js because I wanted to add some style and character to keep the user engaged<br>
and interested in exploring the site without distracting from the navigation and content. The<br>
learning curve was brief with anime.js and I was able to fade color changes in and out on my<br> navigation column.

## Version 1 of README continues below
(***To be updated***)<br>
The site is responsive to screen sizes across a broad range of devices.<br>
The site was written with accessibility in mind. <br>
HTML is semantic to enhance screen reader experience.<br>
HTML on all three pages has been validated with zero warnings or errors outstanding at https://validator.w3.org/<br>
<br>
Markup was written with a mindfulness towards code economy.<br>
Positioning was achieved using Bootstrap 4's grid, where possible, thereby reducing reliance on CSS styling.<br>
Navbar and footer are sticky allowing for easy navigation.<br>
Major sections are commented with descriptions and a clear indentation scheme is apparent<br>
for the benefit of other developers inspecting the markup.<br>
