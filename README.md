## Utilities
* Material-UI - https://material-ui.com/ - MUI makes implementing professional looking components a breeze. Structuring grids and creating a responsive layout are easy and intuitive tasks using their Grid component system. Developed by Google, MUI gives your app an Android ready look right out of the box.

  *Demo of MUI layout*

)

* Animate On Scroll - https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ - AOS is a javascript package that can be imported through React and used to easily create animation effects with a single prop after initialization.

* Formspree - https://formspree.io/ - Formspree allows you to handle forms for free without a dedicated backend. Using MUI components and jsx, I created a form that will send an email to my email address upon user submit.
