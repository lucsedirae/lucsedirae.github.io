This website is a student biography page. 
It contains links to student Jon Deavers' portfolio.
It also contains a contact form with social media links.

The site is responsive to screen sizes from across a broad range of devices.
The site was written with accessibility in mind. HTML is semantic to enhance screen reader experience.

Markup was written with a mindfulness towards code economy.
Positioning was achieved using Bootstrap 4's grid, where possible, thereby reducing reliance on CSS styling.
Navbar and footer are sticky allowing for easy navigation.
Major sections are commented with descriptions and a clear indentation.
scheme is apparent for the benefit of other developers inspecting the markup.
