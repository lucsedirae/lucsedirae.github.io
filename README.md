# Jon Deavers - Profile

Deployed site: https://lucsedirae.github.io/

This website is a student profile page. It features a fun, animated user<br>
interface and intuitive navigation. On the page you will find links to Jon's<br>
portfolio projects and blog articles, contact information, and a short bio.<br>
Below are descriptions of components built and tools used in this application.<br>

## Built with an intentional design philosophy

As I refactored this site I wanted to practice more than just what gets rendered<br>
by the browser. With that goal in mind, I set the following guidelines for myself<br>
* Responsive design to perform consistently regardless of device screen size.
* Written with semantic HTML always top of mind to expand accessibility
* Maximize compatibility and reliability by validating through https://validator.w3.org/<br>
* Be mindful of code economy and produce a **dry** codebase
* Document with comments thoroughly so that fellow developers can follow my design and logic easily.<br>

## Featuring HTML Framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 4.5.2

[Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com) grid system made positioning elements effortless. The carousel component built-in<br>
to Bootstrap is incorporated on the portfolio section to provide subtle and intuitive control<br>
of the slideshow while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic of the user interface.    

## Featuring [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) animation library

"[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) (/ˈæn.ə.meɪ/) is a lightweight JavaScript animation library with a simple, yet <br>
powerful API. It works with CSS properties, SVG, DOM attributes and JavaScript Objects."<br>
-*anime.js homepage*

I incorporated anime.js because I wanted to add some style and character to keep the user engaged<br>
and interested in exploring the site without distracting from the navigation and content. The<br>
learning curve was brief with anime.js and I was able to fade color changes in and out on my<br> navigation column.
