This website is a student biography page. <br>
It contains links to student Jon Deavers' portfolio.<br>
It also contains a contact form with social media links.<br>
<br>
The site is responsive to screen sizes across a broad range of devices.<br>
The site was written with accessibility in mind. <br>
HTML is semantic to enhance screen reader experience.<br>
<br>
Markup was written with a mindfulness towards code economy.<br>
Positioning was achieved using Bootstrap 4's grid, where possible, thereby reducing reliance on CSS styling.<br>
Navbar and footer are sticky allowing for easy navigation.<br>
Major sections are commented with descriptions and a clear indentation scheme is apparent<br>
for the benefit of other developers inspecting the markup.<br>
