        <p>We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. I'll alert the crew. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Sorry, Data. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet</p>
